Basic Rules
------------

The game pits two players against each other on the same screen. Each player tries to bring the opponent's HP down to zero(thinking of changing this rule later) using his abilities to win. The player can also purchase items to make him stronger as well as consumables to provide instant gains in his stats.

Each player has three main stats:HP, Mana and Gold. If a player's HP drops to 0, he loses the game. Mana is required to use abilities. Gold is used to buy items and consumables. All the three stats have a regenration attribute which determines by how much these stats increase every time a player gets his turn.

The battle begins upon clicking the Enter Battle button by either player. This randomly assigns a turn to one of the sides. On his turn a player may use his abilities or purchase things.
